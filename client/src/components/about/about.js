                        <h4>My Story</h4>
                        I've always loved dogs and I have always loved drawing and painting. I was seven years old when I got my first dog, Rex. He was a red merle Australian Shepherd. I drew pictures of him and painted a number of childish portraits during our growing up together. He grew older and I got better at painting. I wanted to capture that unique essence in him, that goofy grin and the way his eyes sparkled. When he died I knew that painting family pets was something I wanted to do. I wanted to paint more than just a cute dog or cat but to connect to the loving spirit of the animal itself. We got another dog, a German Shepherd who I loved in a completely different way. I realized how special each animal that comes into our lives could be. I began painting some of my friendsâ€™ pets and a few commissions here and there. During the painting process I felt like I was meeting the pet and even communicating with them in some silent way.  I feel connected to each and every animal I have painted. I find a lot joy in painting them. So in 2018 I decided to quit my job and go full time painting pet portraits. I am excited to begin this new chapter of my life.
